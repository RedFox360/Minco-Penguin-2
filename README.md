BS POKER RULES!!!
* Each round, the person who gained a card last round goes first and says a hand.
  * Note: If it is the first round, randomly choose.
* You must either say a higher hand than what the previous person said or BS.
  * Note: Direction varies every game.
* This continues until someone says BS.
* When someone calls BS, reveal all cards.
* If the BS'd hand is true, the person who called BS gains a card.
  * If it's false, the BS'd person gains a card.
